How modes (permissions) work

           user permissions   group permissions  anyone permissions
directory  read write execute
d          rwx                rwx                rwx
_          same user as       share a group id   any random person
           owner


executing a regular file means running the program
read for a directory is listing the contents
execute is cding in


The way we store this information

drwxrwxrwx
1111111111
-rw-r--r--
0110100100

4 = 100
2 = 010
1 = 001

  rwx
0b001 = 1
0b010 = 2
0b100 = 4
0b111 = 7

octal has digits 0 - 7

=> one octal digit can represent exactly the rwx cluster

drwxrwxrwx
1111111111
   7  7  7
-rw-r--r--
0110100100
   6  4  4

3 octal digits to represent rwx

if (mode & (1 << 7) != 0) // user has execute permissions




UTF-8
(8 bits)

UTF-16
16 bit basic building blocks
UTF-32

Ascii is a mapping from number to character (and vice versa)
Only 128 characters

There are just way more characters

Other languages

Emojis

Unicode is what represents all this


Characters are not just one byte - they are variable length

Code points are 1-4 bytes
Character has wider meaning and can be very long

Emojis - A person emoji + skin colour qualifier + profession 


UTF-8 is ascii compatible

Ascii text is also UTF-8 text

ascii never uses the top bit
0b01111111

If the top bit is 0, it is a one byte code point (same as ascii)
ascii is 0 through 127
